# ðŸ”‘ Activate Your License
---

FastMove comes with a free trial. The trial version lets you migrate custom files and favorites as
many times as you want. To unlock the rest of the features, you'll need to purchase and
activate your license. Each license is valid for a pair of PCs, the source PC you want to copy data
from and the target PC you want to migrate to.
